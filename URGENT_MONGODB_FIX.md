# üö® URGENT FIX NEEDED: MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist

## The Problem:
Railway deployment failed because MongoDB Atlas is blocking Railway's IP addresses.

**Error:** `Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.`

## The Solution:

### STEP 1: Fix MongoDB Atlas Network Access (IMMEDIATE)

1. **MongoDB Atlas is open in your browser** at the Network Access page
2. **Add Railway IP Address**:
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Select "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - OR add specific Railway IP ranges:
     - `35.196.0.0/14` (Railway US West)
     - `34.75.0.0/16` (Railway US Central)
     - `34.74.0.0/16` (Railway US East)

3. **Click "Confirm"** and wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate

### STEP 2: Retry Railway Deployment

Once MongoDB Atlas is fixed, run:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\rahul\OneDrive\Desktop\ats-system\server"
railway up
```

### STEP 3: Expected Success

After fixing MongoDB access, you should see:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB connected successfully
üöÄ Server running on port 8080
‚úÖ Deployment successful
```

## Current Deployment Status:
- ‚úÖ Railway Project: Linked and configured
- ‚úÖ Environment Variables: Set correctly
- ‚úÖ Build Process: Successful
- ‚ùå MongoDB Connection: **BLOCKED BY IP WHITELIST**
- ‚è≥ Next: Fix Atlas access, then retry deployment

## Admin Login (once fixed):
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `ksreddy@2004`

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Please fix MongoDB Atlas network access now, then we'll retry the deployment!
